"""Extension for unifying the contents of related by separate repositories.

Using pushlog data, this extension can recreate a new repository that is
chronologically ordered by the push times from multiple source repositories.
In other words, it will recreate the repository as if it were a single
repository from the beginning.

The extension also has the ability to create bookmarks in the destination
repository.

This extension was created to unify the discrete Firefox repositories, which
are logically the same but existed as separate repositories for historical
reasons. For that reason, some config options and defaults may not be
appropriate for all repos.

Config Files
------------

Because the configuration for repository unification can be complicated,
a standalone config file is used to define the source repositories and
how they are integrated into the destination repository.

This config file uses the Mercurial config file parser (basically
an INI file). Sections in the config represent source repositories.
Each section can have the following entries:

path (required)
   The filesystem path of the repository.

   It must be a filesystem path.

pullrevs (optional)
   Revset defining which revisions to pull from this repo into the unified
   repo. By default, this is `0:tip`, which means to pull all revisions.

bookmark (optional)
   Name of bookmark to associate with the tip-most commit from this repo.

   If not defined, the section name will be used.

   By default, bookmarks will be created.

nobookmark (optional)
   If defined, no bookmark will be defined for revisions coming from this
   repo.

The [GLOBAL] section defines special global settings. The following settings
can be defined:

stagepath (required)
   Local filesystem path to the repository that will hold contents of all
   source repositories.

   Every changeset from every source repository will be pulled into this repo.
   This provides a common source for adding changesets to the destination repo.

destpath (required)
   Local filesystem path to the final, destination repository.

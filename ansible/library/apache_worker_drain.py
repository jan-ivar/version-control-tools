module: apache_worker_drain
short_description: Waits for Apache workers to drain
description:
     - When doing a rolling update, you often want to wait for active requests
       and connections to drain. Ansible's built-in wait_for module can look
       for TCP connections. However, it counts TIME_WAIT as an active
       connection, which adds significant wait times during rolling updates.
       Waiting for Apache workers to flush is accurate and faster.
    - This module polls Apache's server-status and waits for the worker count
      to reach 1. The count never reaches 0, as the request to server-status
      occupies a worker slot.
options:
  url:
    description:
      - URL for Apache server-status. "?auto" is added automatically.
    default: http://localhost/server-status
  timeout:
    description:
      - How long to wait for worker count to drain
    default: 300

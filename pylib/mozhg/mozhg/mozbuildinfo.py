    WARNING: RISK OF UNTRUSTED CODE EXECUTION.

    moz.build files are Python files and evaluating them requires executing
    Python code. While moz.build files are sandboxed, Python sandboxes aren't
    sufficient security sandboxes. A specially crafted moz.build file could
    almost certainly escape the sandbox and gain access to a) the calling
    Python's frames and variables b) the ability to import arbitrary Python
    modules c) access to the filesystem and the ability to execute any program
    therein. THIS FUNCTION SHOULD ONLY BE CALLED BY PRIVILEGE LIMITED USERS
    AND PROCESSES.
